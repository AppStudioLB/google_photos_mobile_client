### Auth data? Where do i get mine?

Below is a step by step instruction on how to accuire your Google account's mobile auth data in a simplest way possible.

1. Get a rooted android device or an emulator.
2. Connect the device to your PC via ADB.
3. Install https://httptoolkit.com
4. In HTTP Toolkit, select Intercept - Android Device via ADB. Filter traffic with `contains(https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photos.native)`
5. Open Google Photos app and login with your account.
